# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 20, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Today, I completed the Sass course that I started yesterday. I also built a survey form from FreeCodeCamp to practice the concepts I learned about Sass, such as variables, nesting, inheritance, and partials. Additionally, I made the layout responsive and followed the mobile-first approach. Lastly, I used BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology.

**Thoughts:** Firstly, I'm amazed by how much shorter the CSS code becomes and how straightforward it is to write Sass code. Secondly, although I finished quickly, it took me some extra time to get used to the Sass syntax. However, I believe that practicing immediately after learning the basics helped me better understand and apply them. Lastly, I plan to focus on coding consistently every day rather than trying to do a lot in one day.

### Day 2: May 21, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I gained a better understanding of the value of using max-width in building responsive layouts.

**Thoughts**:  I realized that I had been using max-width and width together incorrectly. I set a specific time frame goal to complete my project, and I successfully achieved it. Additionally, I aimed to write shorter yet responsive CSS, and I accomplished that as well. I had some concerns about the way I was naming classes using BEM.

### Day 7: May 29, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I finished the dashboard and i started and finished the UI of the rock paper scissors game i'm working on.

**Thoughts**: I have a bug in the dashboard mainly in the main section the height of the items if i write a value for the height is bad because creates an space that shouldn't be there, if i don't declare the height it will have a design error, it was frustrating.

### Day 8: May 30, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I did most of the logic.

**Thoughts**: Is complicated for me the management of more than one button it tends, i learned with this project to use target and i'm trying to get used to the new logic of JavaScript after using java, it was one thing the easy projects in JS but this game is challenging me and giving me headache.

### Day 12: June 3, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I finished the UI of the sketch and i started the logic.

**Thoughts**: I learn today things by doing the logic in javascript, things i hadn't put in practice before, i had some conflicts between the logic and the UI after i finished the least and it was really frustrating but i resolved that.

### Day 13: June 4, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I finished the UI the sketch.

**Thoughts**: The things I think are the easiest always ending being harder to figure out, i finished the sketch faster than i though and also with less javascript code.

### Day 14: June 5, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I started the calculator and finished the UI of the three different themes.

**Thoughts**: it's the second time i work with sass and i'm pleased with the results i think that my skills of building layouts are getting better. Today i track the time it took me to build the base of the calculator and the mixin, it took me less than two hours, i'm gaining more confidence at the time to use grid and it's all because of the hours practicing and all the layout i've built. Now i'm planning to first write all the steps to make the functions work and i'm going to write some pseudocode.

### Day 15: June 6, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I started the logic of the calculator.

**Thoughts**: Last night i wrote some logic of the code but today i'm really frustrated with the process because i'm struggling with the logic of the calculator and with organazing the code inside functions and don't have it all the code in the event listener, because that is what i was doing, so i'm going to leave this for now and continue tomorrow.

### Day 16: June 10, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I finished all the logic of the operations.

**Thoughts**: I struggled a lot with finding the logic of the calculator so i took a break and finally today i could figure it out but i couldn't solve something(operate jus two values first and then the rest), i don't think i'll do that, i started with the logic for the switch of the themes, but i'll maybe do that tomorrow.

### Day 17: June 11, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I finished the calculator.

**Thoughts**: i did the thing that changes the theme and i correct some little things of the layout and cleaned the code, I think i'm going to take the rest of the night to rest and tomorrow i'm going to start the project that i scheduled and i hope i'll finish the project in the deadline i have.

### Day 18: June 12, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I started the library project.

**Thoughts**: I started the library project given by the odin project, in the past i've learn about the object pattern but i didnt rally pay attention because i prefer the oop pattern and now i re learned about it and with this project im going to practice, today i did the html structure and most of the styles.

### Day 19: June 13, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I started the JavaScript logig.

**Thoughts**: After i finished the styles and started the JavaScript logic in the evening, i want to remember myself to never omit the type = "button" attribute because of this the program throw me an error that wasn't going to affect its run but it annoyed me and the error was because i always thought that the type button attribute wasn't necessary and i always omited it and spoiler alert it is. I learned about some javascript properties for the dom manipulation of the inputs and i think i still have to practice the object pattern but i understood it use and i also have to organized better the code before pushing the final code.

### Day 20: June 14, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I finished the library project.

**Thoughts**: With this projects i learned to write comments for the code it was quiet interesting and it help me ro understand even better the code and the flow of my program also it's scary to delete a variable that you think it's doing nothing but when you do that the program throws you a bunch of error. I loved doing this project and i'm excited about the things that i'm going to put in practice with the next projects.

### Day 21: June 20, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Webpack finished me.

**Thoughts**: I started to learn webpack and i didn't code on my own because i was trying to grasp the new concepts, i understand all the concepts it took me two days but the day that i started to do the projects on my own, i had a bunch of errors, finally it worked when i followed the notes and steps that i write when i was reading the documentation instead of asking chatgpt for the steps to build a project or helped with the errors, today i started the todo list app with webpack and all is working i have to be honest and admit that i'm scared of something going bad and i have to put in practice and read about the production stage in webpack, also vite is faster and maybe i have to learn it because of the project of my university my partner is using it but i have to use webpack on my own because i can't lose the knowledge and is what job offers want. I was doing research about it and the employers asked for typescript too, but i'm going to focus in the road map that i have and focus in that, typescript can wait until i get a job. Also i'm thinking about doing a more simpler todo app, the one from frontend mentor and i'm going to use a library.

### Day 22: June 25, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I started de UI of the todo list.

**Thoughts**: I've been feeling a little down and overwhelmed with the todo list because i can't seem to find a way to make all that work, i decided that i'm just going to finished the UI and start the logic step by step, i feel overwhelmed because i'm using for the fist time things that i just learn.

### Day 23: June 26, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I finsihed the UI.

**Thoughts**: I finished the ui i had some issues when i started doing one evemt listener because for the first time i've used a library.

### Day 24: June 27, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I started the module of the ui.

**Thoughts**: I correct the event listener and i started to work with the module ui, i had a bunch of warnings in webpack but i used a plugin for the css and it worked, i admit i was about to give up with webpack because i'm fed up of all the errors of webpack, i'm curious of the lazy loading in my next project i think i'll use it.

### Day 25: June 28, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I started to do the functions.

**Thoughts**: I coded in the morning for an hour a few functions but at night i think i will code more. 

**Link(s) to work**: [Todo List]()

### Day 26: June 30, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I started to use the logic.

**Thoughts**: working with modules is cool, i have to organize the code and add comments because they are needed, also i have to organize myself because it's taking me more time because i'm not following the path that i marked before starting the project.

### Day 27: July 2, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Progressing.

**Thoughts**: I'm frustrated with the amount of time that is taking me to finish this project, i'm stuck with a part of connecting the elements with the logic, this and the part of editing and deleting elements are going to be my obstacles, i'm not used to this is more easy with data bases. i remember something the json and local storage part are the real challenge. Today i didn't write much code because i'm stuck in that part, tomorrow i have the goal to fix the problem and at least finish the function of deleting.

### Day 28: July 3, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Almost there.

**Thoughts**: I needed to set an order, a goal, focus in coding and i did a lot of progress in less than four hours i finished most of the things. I have left to do just the edit task method and then the unknown part: the local storage with json. I still have an hour more to code and tomorrow i have to work more than other days, i won't burn myself today so i can code tomorrow.
