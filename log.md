# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 20, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Today, I completed the Sass course that I started yesterday. I also built a survey form from FreeCodeCamp to practice the concepts I learned about Sass, such as variables, nesting, inheritance, and partials. Additionally, I made the layout responsive and followed the mobile-first approach. Lastly, I used BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology.

**Thoughts:** Firstly, I'm amazed by how much shorter the CSS code becomes and how straightforward it is to write Sass code. Secondly, although I finished quickly, it took me some extra time to get used to the Sass syntax. However, I believe that practicing immediately after learning the basics helped me better understand and apply them. Lastly, I plan to focus on coding consistently every day rather than trying to do a lot in one day.

### Day 2: May 21, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I gained a better understanding of the value of using max-width in building responsive layouts.

**Thoughts**:  I realized that I had been using max-width and width together incorrectly. I set a specific timeframe goal to complete my project, and I successfully achieved it. Additionally, I aimed to write shorter yet responsive CSS, and I accomplished that as well. I had some concerns about the way I was naming classes using BEM.
