# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 20, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Today, I completed the Sass course that I started yesterday. I also built a survey form from FreeCodeCamp to practice the concepts I learned about Sass, such as variables, nesting, inheritance, and partials. Additionally, I made the layout responsive and followed the mobile-first approach. Lastly, I used BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology.

**Thoughts:** Firstly, I'm amazed by how much shorter the CSS code becomes and how straightforward it is to write Sass code. Secondly, although I finished quickly, it took me some extra time to get used to the Sass syntax. However, I believe that practicing immediately after learning the basics helped me better understand and apply them. Lastly, I plan to focus on coding consistently every day rather than trying to do a lot in one day.

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
