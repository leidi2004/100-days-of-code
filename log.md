# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 20, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Today, I completed the Sass course that I started yesterday. I also built a survey form from FreeCodeCamp to practice the concepts I learned about Sass, such as variables, nesting, inheritance, and partials. Additionally, I made the layout responsive and followed the mobile-first approach. Lastly, I used BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology.

**Thoughts:** Firstly, I'm amazed by how much shorter the CSS code becomes and how straightforward it is to write Sass code. Secondly, although I finished quickly, it took me some extra time to get used to the Sass syntax. However, I believe that practicing immediately after learning the basics helped me better understand and apply them. Lastly, I plan to focus on coding consistently every day rather than trying to do a lot in one day.

### Day 2: May 21, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I gained a better understanding of the value of using max-width in building responsive layouts.

**Thoughts**:  I realized that I had been using max-width and width together incorrectly. I set a specific time frame goal to complete my project, and I successfully achieved it. Additionally, I aimed to write shorter yet responsive CSS, and I accomplished that as well. I had some concerns about the way I was naming classes using BEM.

### Day 4: May 23, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I've finished the challenge of freecodecamp.

**Thoughts**: I think i'm getting better the menu in big screens was the only thing that gave me problems and the code blocks in small screens.

### Day 7: May 29, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I finished the dashboard and i started and finished the UI of the rock paper scissors game i'm working on.

**Thoughts**: I have a bug in the dashboard mainly in the main section the height of the items if i write a value for the height is bad because creates an space that shouldn't be there, if i don't declare the height it will have a design error, it was frustrating.

### Day 8: May 30, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I did most of the logic.

**Thoughts**: Is complicated for me the management of more than one button it tends, i learned with this project to use target and i'm trying to get used to the new logic of JavaScript after using java, it was one thing the easy projects in JS but this game is challenging me and giving me headache.

### Day 9: May 31, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I did a Responsive Header.

**Thoughts**: It was pretty easy, but also little challenging without using media queries.

### Day 10: June 1, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I finished the rps game.

**Thoughts**: I didn't want to code tonight, but i did the rule just for ten minutes and i ended up finishing the game, it was just little details to do. I want to add audio to the game, but it was pretty simple.

### Day 11: June 2, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I started a Etch-Sketch.

**Thoughts**: I added the audio to the Rock Paper Scissors game y i did a mock up of the E-Sketch i'm working on.

### Day 12: June 3, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I finished the UI of the sketch and i started the logic.

**Thoughts**: I learn today things by doing the logic in javascript, things i hadn't put in practice before, i had some conflicts between the logic and the UI after i finished the least and it was really frustrating but i resolved that.

### Day 13: June 4, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I finished the UI the sketch.

**Thoughts**: The things I think are the easiest always ending being harder to figure out, i finished the sketch faster than i though and also with less javascript code.

### Day 14: June 5, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I started the calculator and finished the UI of the three different themes.

**Thoughts**: it's the second time i work with sass and i'm pleased with the results i think that my skills of building layouts are getting better. Today i track the time it took me to build the base of the calculator and the mixin, it took me less than two hours, i'm gaining more confidence at the time to use grid and it's all because of the hours practicing and all the layout i've built. Now i'm planning to first write all the steps to make the functions work and i'm going to write some pseudocode.

### Day 15: June 6, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I started the logic of the calculator.

**Thoughts**: Last night i wrote some logic of the code but today i'm really frustrated with the process because i'm struggling with the logic of the calculator and with organazing the code inside functions and don't have it all the code in the event listener, because that is what i was doing, so i'm going to leave this for now and continue tomorrow.

### Day 16: June 10, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I finished all the logic of the operations.

**Thoughts**: I struggled a lot with finding the logic of the calculator so i took a break and finally today i could figure it out but i couldn't solve something(operate jus two values first and then the rest), i don't think i'll do that, i started with the logic for the switch of the themes, but i'll maybe do that tomorrow.

### Day 17: June 10, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I finished the calculator.

**Thoughts**: i did the thing that changes the theme and i correct some little things of the layout and cleaned the code, I think i'm going to take the rest of the night to rest and tomorrow i'm going to start the project that i scheduled and i hope i'll finish the project in the deadline i have.
